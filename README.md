# EVoting

## üîíThe problem
Traditional voting systems, whether paper-based or electronic, face multiple challenges such as:

- <ins>Security vulnerabilities</ins> (hacking, vote tampering, lack of transparency)
- <ins>Inefficencies</ins> (long queues, slow counting, human errors)
- <ins>Accessibility issues</ins> (people with disabilities, remote voters, overseas citizens)
- <ins>Voter fraud and impersonation</ins>

### üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Target users
Government and Election Commissions - To manage and conduct secure elections.
Citizens/Voters - To cast their votes remotely and securely.
Political Parties & Candidates - To ensure fair elections with reliable results.
Independent Observers & Auditors - To verify election integrity.
 

## ‚úÖThe solution
Our e-voting system will provide a **secure and efficient** way for people to vote online using a web-based platform. It will:

- Ensure security through encrypted databases and strong user authentication.
- Prevent fraud by verifying voter identities through unique creditentials (e.g., ID and OTP verification).
- Increase accessibility by allowing people to vote from home using a web browser.
- Provide transparency by keeping a detailed and auditable voting log.
 

## ‚õìÔ∏è‚Äçüí•Technologies will be used:
- Database Management (MySQL, PostgreSQL or MongoDB) - To store voter data and votes securely.
- Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python/Flask or Node.js) - To build the voting platform.
- Encryption (AES, RSA) - To protect vote data and ensure security.
- Multi-Factor Authentication (Email/OTP Verification) - To verify users.
- Logging & Auditing Tools - To track voting activity and ensure transparency.
