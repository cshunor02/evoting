# Flask Backend

## Main functionalities
- Start server
- (TODO) Multi-factor authentication

## Start the Server

To start the backend server, we have to first install a package called Flask, and routes:

```
pip install flask
pip install routes
```

Move into the correct folder via Terminal
```
cd ~/evoting/backend
```
and start the server with the following command line format
```
python .\main.py <hostname> <port number>
```
We tested the program with the following values:

- \<hostname\> - localhost, 127.0.0.1
- \<port number\> - 8080
