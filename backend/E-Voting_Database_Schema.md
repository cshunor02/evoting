# E-Voting System â€“ Database Schema

This document outlines the core database structure for the backend of our e-voting application. The system is built with SQLAlchemy and follows an anonymous voting design using a containerized MariaDB environment.

---

## Overview

The following tables are defined:

- [`Election`](#election)
- [`Vote`](#vote)
- [`VotingPolicy`](#votingpolicy)
- [`Candidate`](#candidate)

Each table uses UUIDs for primary keys and includes relationships to ensure data integrity.

- The project runs inside Docker using MariaDB, with tables created automatically at startup.
- User login/registration tables are intentionally excluded to maintain **anonymous voting**.
